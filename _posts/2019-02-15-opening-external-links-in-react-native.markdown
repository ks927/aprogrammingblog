# How to Open SMS/Email/Twitter/Facebook from React Native Application

Most apps have a "Share on 'other app'" button these days. That button most likely opens that other app on your device, and maybe even pre-populates an input with custom text for you. React Native, once again, makes adding this feature fairly straightforward and painless. Both for iOS and Android. Here is an example of a screen with multiple options, and the following is how to get those buttons to work.

![invite page]({{ site.url }}/codeks/assets/images/invitepage.png "Invite Page"){:class="img-sm-landscape"}

![share buttons]({{ site.url }}/codeks/assets/images/share_buttons.png "Invite Page"){:class="img-landscape"}

![share function]({{ site.url }}/codeks/assets/images/share_function.png "Invite Page"){:class="img-landscape"}
