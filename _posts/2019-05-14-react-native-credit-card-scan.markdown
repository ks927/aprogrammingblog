<!-- # Install NPM package

(1) npm install react-native-awesome-card-io --save

(2) react-native link react-native-awesome-card-io

# Build and Run Project

When I tried running the app at this point in XCode, I got a build error that looked like something like this - `build input file cannot be found ygfloatoptional cpp`.
Here is how I solved the issue.

(3) In XCode, right-click the Libraries folder

![XCode Libraries]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/scancard_xcode.png "Libraries"){:class="img-portrait"}


(4) Select `Add Files to APP_NAME`

(5) Select node_modules -> react-native-awesome-card-io -> ios -> RNCardIO.xcodeproj

(6) Target your project, and select Build Phases

![XCode Build Phases]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/scancard_xcode1.png "Build Phases"){:class="img-landscape"}

(7) Click the `+` at the bottom of the Link Binary with Libraries list

(8) Select libRNCardIO.a and click `Add`

(9) Restart your metro bundler and Build and Run your project

(10) $$$
