This project was the most time-consuming, head-scratching, frustrating assignment since starting work eight months ago. And in the end, it took nothing more than changing two numbers to solve. As nice as it may have been to have known this beforehand, there are a few takeaways from the experience. **Always find silver linings.** 

1. **How to deal with frustration.** When things don't go as smoothly as you planned while programming, your heart starts beating a little quicker, sweat surfaces at your pores, and involuntary, animal-like groans rise from your workspace. Maybe you resign to using one finger to undo, redo, or change one line before reloading the project, hoping your desparation will miraculously fix the bug. This is the state I reach when I know it's time to step away from the keys. 

2. **Thinking outside the box to find non-obvious solutions.** Specifically - do not trust the documentation.
