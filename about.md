### Why blog?

Virtually every week since I've started working full-time as a software developer, I've encountered a problem that I did not know how to solve - often not even knowing where to begin. Everyday I use Google to search "how to do X" or "X not working" in hopes of finding a StackOverflow or blog post that addresses my specific question. While most of the time I adapt what I find to fit my situation, there are some circumstances where a solution is little more than a copy-paste job. The more resources available, the better the odds are of finding exactly what you are looking for. This blog is a way for me to [share my experiences]({{ site.url }}/career/2019/01/25/self-teaching-journey.html) and add to the pool of resources in hopes of making someone else's job easier.
